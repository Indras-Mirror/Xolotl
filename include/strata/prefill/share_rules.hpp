// include/strata/prefill/share_rules.hpp - when the default CPU prefill share is worth arming (no GPU needed to check).
//
// The share hands the idle CPU pool experts the GPU would otherwise stream over PCIe.  With every expert resident in
// the GPU's cache nothing is streamed, so there is nothing to take; arming the default only moves the staged-chunk
// limit and costs ~5% at 1,000 tokens (#1595: V100, 3 rounds x 3 runs).  An explicit STRATA_PREFILL_CPU_SHARE is
// honoured by Prefill::arm_cpu_share whatever this says.

// 1,000 tokens).  A chunk of 1-3K tokens routes to nearly every expert of every layer, so with half the experts resident one pass over the rest at the link's
// speed is its floor (RTX PRO 5000 with a 28 GB/s link and 12,437 of 24,576 experts resident: 0.97-1.04 s for any 1K-4K prompt) and the CPU share takes
// part of that pass: prompt speed +151% at 1K, +45% at 2K (TTFT 1.07 -> 0.74 s), +99% / +32% with 8 pool workers; 4K and above unchanged, and a limit
// of 8,192 loses 1-6% at 4K-8K.  First-token KL after a 1.1-2.8K prompt: mean 0.011, top-1 100%.  STRATA_PREFILL_CPU_SHARE_MAX=1024 restores the old limit.
